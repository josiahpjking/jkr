\description{
This generic function calculates the r squared and pseudo r-squared for
a variety of(generalized) linear (mixed) model fits.
Currently implemented for \code{\link{lm}}, \code{\link{lmerTest::merMod}},
and \code{\link{nlme::lme}} objects.
Implementing methods usually call \code{\link{.rsquared.glmm}}
