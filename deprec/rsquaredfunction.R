#' R-squared and pseudo-rsquared for a list of (generalized) linear (mixed) models

#' This function calls the generic \code{\link{r.squared}} function for each of the
#' models in the list and rbinds the outputs into one data frame
#'
#' @param a list of fitted (generalized) linear (mixed) model objects
#' @return a dataframe with one row per model, and "Class",
#'         "Family", "Marginal", "Conditional" and "AIC" columns

  # Iterate over each model in the list
